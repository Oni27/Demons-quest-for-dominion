             <p> Master, what is a new world like? Describe it to me.<br/>
                 Ah, a new world, my apprentice. It's beyond anything you've ever imagined, a realm of boundless wonders. But it's also a place of danger, teeming with demons locked in battle for supremacy.<br/>
                 Demons? I was anticipating tales of gods and goddesses.<br/>
                 The creation of worlds remains an enigma even to the most powerful mages. However, I can reveal who governs them from their very inception â€“ these accursed demons. Possessing the ability to transcend the boundaries between worlds, they descend upon newly born realms, engaging in fierce battles with their counterparts from other dimensions to establish dominance. <br/>
                 Why do they seek to control more than one world?<br/>
                 Power. They are driven by an insatiable hunger for power. It's a ceaseless pursuit, for by controlling multiple realms, they amplify their own strength.</p>
